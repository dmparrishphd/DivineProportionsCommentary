# Notation for lines

Herein, we prefer to denote a line

    (c, a, b)
    
(We prefer to place the terms in ascending order of order, i.e., zero-order term first, first order terms second.)

We prefer to write the equation of a line similarly:

    c + a * x + b * y = 0
    
# Definition of _pitch_

The _pitch_ of line `(c, a, b)` is `(a, b)`.

Pitch is not quite the same as _slope_, since `(0, b)` is a well-defined pitch, but slope `b/0` is undefined.
