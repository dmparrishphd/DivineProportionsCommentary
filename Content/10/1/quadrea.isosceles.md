Quadrea of an Isosceles Triangle
================================

For an
isosceles triangle
with quadrances `Q1` and `Q2`, where two of the three quadrances equal `Q2`,
the quadrea is

    Q1 * ( 4 * Q2 - Q1 )

This can be shown by substituting the quadrances into the definition of quadrea (DP 5.5),
expanding the square of sums,
canceling the `Q2`-squared terms, and
factoring out `Q1`.
