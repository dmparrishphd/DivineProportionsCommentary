Oriented Segment
================

Given two distinct points `A2` and `A3`, `A2 = [x2, y2]`, `A3 = [x3, y3]`,
we might compte `a = x3 - x2` and `b = y3 - y2`.
And we might define `A1 = [x2 - b, y2 + a]`.
Then _oriented triangle_ `(A1, A2, A3)` has positive _signed area_ (see Section 9.3) `a ^ 2 + b ^ 2`.

We might say that `A1` is on the _left_ side of the _oriented segment_ or _oriented line_ `(A2, A3)`.
