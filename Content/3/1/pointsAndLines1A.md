Definition of Zbox
===================

A **Z**box ("zee box") is a _quadrilateral_ (See definition of quadrilateral, DP 3.6)

    ( (x1, y1), (x2, y1), (x2, y2), (x1, y2) )

where `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2` are _integers_: i.e.; `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2` in **Z**.

A &Zopf;box is _aligned_ with the Cartesian lattice.

Special Cases
-------------

A **Z**box

    ( (x1, y1), (x1, y1), (x1, y1), (x1, y1) ) == (x1, y1)
    
is a point; more specifically, a **lattice point**.

A **Z**box

    ( (x1, y1), (x1, y1), (x2, y1), (x2, y1) ) == ( (x1, y1), (x2, y1) )

is a segment aligned with the Cartesian lattice and running along the primary, or "x"-, axis.
